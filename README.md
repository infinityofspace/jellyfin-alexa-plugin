## Requirements

Before you continue, make sure you meet the following requirements:
- Jellyfin server: 10.8+
- [Amazon developer account](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/ask-overviews/create-developer-account.html)
- publicly accessible Jellyfin server with a domain and a valid SSL certificate

## Installation

1. You can either use the prebuilds or build the plugin by yourself:
   1. Use prebuilds, here you have also two options:
      1. Use the plugin repository (recommend):
         1. Open the admin dashboard of your Jellyfin server.
         2. Go to Plugins and select the `Repositories` tab.
         3. Add a new repository with the following URL (name can be anything): `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infinityofspace/jellyfin-alexa-plugin/master/manifest.json`
         4. Now you can find the plugin under the `General` category in the `Catalog` tab.
      2. Manually download the latest release:
         1. Download the lastes release from the [releases page](https://github.com/infinityofspace/jellyfin-alexa-plugin/releases).
         2. Extract the zip file.
         3. Copy the folder `Jellyfin.Plugin.AlexaSkill` of the extracted zip to the `plugins` folder of your Jellyfin server.
   2. Build the plugin by yourself:
      1. Ensure you have .NET Core 6.0 SDK setup and installed.
      2. Clone the repository and checkout the latest release tag:
            ```bash
            git clone https://github.com/infinityofspace/jellyfin-alexa-plugin.git
            cd jellyfin-alexa-plugin
            git checkout <version>
            ```
      3. Build plugin with the following command:
            ```bash
            dotnet publish --configuration Release
            ```
      4. Create a folder named `Jellyfin.Plugin.AlexaSkill` inside the `plugins` folder of your Jellyfin server data folder.
      5. Copy everything from the folder `Jellyfin.Plugin.AlexaSkill/bin/Release/net6.0/publish/` to the previously created folder `Jellyfin.Plugin.AlexaSkill` in your Jellyfin server `plugin` directory. 
2. Restart your Jellyfin server.
3. Go to the plugin settings page and fill out the required values, then click `Save` and `Rebuild Skill` (the first build may take some time). You can find [here](https://github.com/infinityofspace/jellyfin-alexa-plugin/wiki/Configuration) more details on how to fill out the required values.
4. Now go into your Alexa app and link your desired Jellyfin account.
5. You are now ready to use the skill. Let's start the skill with "Alexa, start Jellyfin Player" (assuming the invocation name has not been customized).
